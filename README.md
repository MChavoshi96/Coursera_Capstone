coursera IBM capstone project

This is a mini-project done for the IBM applied data science capstone. Different locations of districts in Toronto and New York are found, then the most popular venues of each district is retrieved from Foursquare API and finally, all districts are clustered based on popular venues. At last, the clusters will contain similar districts in both cities.
